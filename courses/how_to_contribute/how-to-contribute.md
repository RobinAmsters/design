In this course, you will learn how to contribute to this site.  Follow through these next units to learn:

* The general purpose and format of this site
* The templates used
* Using markdown and uploading material

###Introduction





Before contributing, it is first important to understand how material on this site is organized.  Since no two teachers have the same teaching style, we needed to prepare for material coming into the site in all manner of shapes and sizes.  We decided to address this issue by establishing a standard format to organize material on the site which we hope will provide common grounds upon which collaboration can occur.  This format enables incoming material to be categorized, which will in turn reduce redundancy and will enable a means for users to easily navigate through material on the site.

Everything is filed in a hierarchy not to different from a class syllabus: course, unit, and topics (lessons, tutorials, challenges).  Here’s example of what a course might look like using this format:

**Course**

* Unit
   * Lessons
   * Tutorial
   * Lesson
   * Tutorial
   * Challenge
* Unit
   * Lesson
   * Lesson
   * Tutorial
   * Challenge
   * Challenge
* Unit
   * Tutorial
   * Challenge

In addition, we have written guidelines for how to define these categories:

**Course**: This is basically a syllabus and contains the units that will be covered in the course.  Metadata in the header for the course includes: title, abstract, tags , prerequisites (by course or by topic), skills, requirements, and version/compatibility tags.


**Unit**: These are the various topics covered in the course.  We can think of the units as individual folders that contain all the material; any lesson, tutorial or challenge will belong to at least one unit.


**Lesson**: Lessons will be where the educators present all the information and building blocks they are giving to the students - in slides, videos, notes, diagrams… etc. A topic can have multiple lessons, maybe to give students stopping points to apply the information they are receiving.


**Tutorial**: This is where students can be walked-through an application of what they are learning.  If it’s a new programming concept for instance, it can be a series of questions that get the student to walk through an example of the material.  (The idea here is really similar to what we think of online tutorials - these are step by step instructions and examples).


**Challenge**:  This is the fun part.  Here is where educators can post material that get the student to apply and expand on the concepts covered.  Here is where you would find homework problems, problem sets, projects, open ended questions… etc.  The challenges will be labelled as either “recommended” or “extended.”

All elements (courses, units, lessons, tutorials, and challenges) will be indexed and will reference the material they belong with.  In addition, units and the elements they contain can also be cross-referenced if material is applicable to more than one course and/or unit.  But we’ll talk about indexing and referencing later on.
