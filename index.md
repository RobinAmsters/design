# Hello, welcome to ROS Courses!

----

The purpose of this site is to provide an online space for **educational material** concerning [Robotics Operating System](http://www.ros.org/) (ROS) and general Robotics (sort of like a course/lesson/activity database).  It is our goal is to **collaboratively create online robotics courses** that educators can both edit and pull from in order to use with their own students. 

Contributors can provide material ranging anywhere from individual activities and informational content to entire courses.  We want teaching and learning robotics to be accessible to all!
