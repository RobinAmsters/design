#Navigating this Site and Repository

##Finding Courses

All educational material in this site is organized in **courses**. All courses can be found in the [All courses]({{ site.baseurl }}/all-courses) tab in the top menu. In addition, there is also a tab in the top menu where you can find [all courses organized by category]({{ site.baseurl }}/categories). You can also browse through material on the site by its **tags** in the [Tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags) tab bound in the top menu.

Once you are in a course, you can easily navigate through its units and topics by using the sidebar on the righthand side of the site. This will show the units in a course and the topics in a unit.

##Learning how to Contribute

To learn how to **add/edit material** to this site, you can view the [How to Contribute Material]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute) tab in the top menu or you can view the course on [How to Contribute]({{ site.baseurl }}/courses/how-to-contribute/how-to-contribute).

##Organization of Repository

Once in the repository, we have organized the courses as follows:

Each course has its own separate folder within the **courses** folder (NOTE that the name of each folder is the same as the name of the file for the course that it contains; for example, the **how-to-contribute.md** course file is within the design/courses/**how-to-contribute**/ folder).

</p>

Once in one of the course folders, you will find the course .md file, any images included in the courses, as well as two subfolders: **units**, and **topics**. 

From there, all units are found in the **units** folder and all topics are found in the **topics** folder (lesosns, tutorials, and challenges) as .md files.
